		<h3>Voice over Internet Protocol</h3>
		<p>Voice over Internet Protocol or VoIP - also known as IP Telephony - is a technology that delivers voice communications over the internet.

		<h3>File Sharing</h3>
		<p>One of the biggest advantages for businesses of the internet has been the ability to share relevant files with all parties who are involved in a project. Sharing can be public or private and how much access each individual has can be set - some may be allowed read only access while others may have full access including the ability to edit files. The three ways of sharing files are peer to peer as in the case of Napster which was shut down due to the sharing of copyrighted material, file hosting services such as dropbox whose servers are used exclusively to host clients' files. These can then be accessed and downloaded by users. The third way is through file sync and sharing - owncloud gives the user full control over their files and data.</p>
