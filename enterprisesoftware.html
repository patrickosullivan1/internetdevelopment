		<h3>How Enterprise Software differs from uses of the Internet</h3>
	<h4>Enterprise Software is differentiated from the uses of the internet in that it is dedicated software to help businesses manage their operations and achieve their goals while optimising productivity and financial savings. The uses of the internet focus mainly on how individuals can avail of the internet. It can assist many of the business functions from aiding the dissemination of information (Content Management System or CMS) , managing the production process (Supply Chain Management), managing customer relations (Customer Relations Management) and revenue management (On line payment systems).</h4>

		<h3>Content Management Systems</h3>
		<p>A Content Management System is a software used to create and manage digital content. It simplifies the process insofar as the creators of the content can operate with little or no technical knowledge. The uses of a content management system can extend beyond the creation and maintenance of web sites. It can be used to manage press relations , to help with inventory management and with order processing and fulfilment (Order details can be output, packing slips, address labels and invoices can be generated from the system). The term, however, is more generally taken to refer to the creation and updating of content for the internet. A CMS has 2 components - a CMA (Content Management Application) that allows for the generation and management of content for the site and a CDA (Content Delivery Application) which takes the content generated by the CMA and delivers it to your audience. Examples of free open source CMAs are Joomla, Mambo and plone. Wordpress, mentioned in the Web Applications section is a commercial CMA costing anywhere from $50 to thousands depending on the complexity of your requirements</p>

		<h3>Supply Chain Management</h3>
		<p>Supply Chain Management (SCM) relates to the natural business flow. Raw materials are sourced, then shipped to the production facility and from there to storage. The delivery from storage to end users or stores must be managed from there. Most businesses today operate on a Just in Time basis - the raw material or finished product arrive at the destination just when it is needed so that companies do not have money tied up in inventory which, if stored for too long, may become damaged or obsolete. SCM software is an essential tool if JIT is to be implemented successfully. Information within and without the company must be timely so that goods can be shipped when inventories reach a low point.There are 3 main flows in SCM - Product Flow (the movement of raw materials and goods between all parties), Information Flow (companies must know when items will be delivered) and the Financial Flow (agreement of credit terms and payment schedules). Everybody involved must be aware of and consent to terms and conditions to avoid holdups in the chain. There are 2 main types of SCM - Planning (optimum way to fill order) and Execution (when order has been placed all the details of it are available from where it is in the chain to where the payments are). Among the benefits of a good SCM system is the ability to accurately estimate consumer demand and therefore quantities needed so money is not lost by ordering too much or foregone by ordering too few. Two of the leading SCM solutions providers are SAP and Highjump.

		<h3>Customer Relations Management</h3>
		<p>In order to survive in today's ultra-competitive business environment, companies must be able to anticipate their customers' demands and meet them. They have to be responsive to issues that their customers have and solve them in a timely manner. Customer Relations Management software greatly increases firms' ability to compile information on their customers and to stay in contact with them. By automating in a manner that seems non automated, business can form what, on the face of it, is a personal relationship with the customer. Information gathering on customers is key and product planning, marketing campaigns, sponsorships can all be planned based on the attitudes and concerns of the customer. This information resource has to be available to anyone within the company who can benefit from having it and the evolution of the cloud has made this possible. The effectiveness of promotional campaigns can be assessed and discontinued if ineffective. Examples of CRM software are salesforce and zoho.

		<h3>Online Payments</h3>
		<p>The facility to pay online has been very beneficial to business. Instead of having to extend credit terms, they can now be paid at the time the order is placed, thus aiding cash flow. While payment by credit card is still the most popular way, other, less involved, ways of paying online are gaining popularity. Paypal accepts credit card payments as well as bank transfers without the necessity of creating a merchant account. Another option is Square which provides a business with a free online store and they charge per transaction through the store. Invoices can be collected or paid through square and they provide a credit card reader for card payments. Stripe is another whose benefit is that the customer stays on your site and is not redirected elsewhere when paying. Mobile payment methods working in conjunction with online such as apple pay for apple phones and google pay for android are also used in what is fast becoming a cashless economy.
